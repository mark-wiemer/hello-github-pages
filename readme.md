# Hello GitHub Pages!

Hosted at [mark-wiemer.github.io/hello-github-pages](https://mark-wiemer.github.io/hello-github-pages/)

Getting started with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Notes:

- GitHub Pages seems to deploy each html file independently: The home page may have updated, but that doesn't mean the about page is also up-to-date! Be patient and review the html :)

Other tools:

- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) to better track changes to images
- GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the site

Developer tools:

- Node.js to run QoL scripts
- Prettier to format the repo
